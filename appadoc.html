    <h2>Back Story</h2>
    <p>
        Appa comes from the animated series, Avatar: The Last Airbender. In the show Appa is the Avatar's flying bison, which was chosen for a pet when they were both young. <br>
        Appa came into my possession because the Avatar needs a vacation. Before he left he made sure to tell the the commands Appa responds to and how often to feed him.
    </p>
    <h2>States</h2>
    <h4>Relaxed</h4>
    <p>Appa is normally in this state by default and will always revert back to this state.</p>
    <h4>Happy</h4>
    <p>Appa is happy when he is given attention, fed berries, or played with. Who wouldn't want to make him happy!</p>
    <h4>Sad</h4>
    <p>Appa is sad when he is ignored. Ignoring him enough will make him cry.</p>
    <h4>Crying</h4>
    <p>If ignored enough Appa will begin to cry, to stop this show him attention or try to cheer him up.</p>
    <h4>Hungry</h4>
    <p>Appa being hungry is one of the more difficult states. His hunger is determined by the time that goes on and it can be fed by giving him berries or feeding it.<br>
        Although one will give more huger points than the other.</p>
    <h4>Tired</h4>
    <p>Appa gets tired after playing with him, or you reading him a bed time story. In order to make him relaxed you can feed him.</p>
    <h4>Sleeping</h4>
    <p>When Appa is sleeping he can't do much, so you  must wake him up. In order to wake Appa one can click the Wake Button. To get Appa to sleep it can be done by <br>
    Bed Time Story, randomly after playing with him, cuddling while tired, or petting while tired.</p>

    <h2>Advice for other Programmers</h2>
    <p>In order to expand on Appa you must have an understanding of JavaScript and conditionals. Most to the buttons and states use if and else if statements to check to see<br>
    which state it is in. To add more to this code simply add more states and be aware the affects future buttons have on past states and vice versa, it will constantly need to be <br>
    modified in order to keep up with future updates.</p>
