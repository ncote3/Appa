        <h1>Appa</h1>
        <h3>Developed and designed by Noah Cote</h3>
        <hr>
        <p>This is Appa, he is a flying bison with a range of emotions, which include:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Relaxed</li>
            <li>Happy</li>
            <li>Sad</li>
            <li>Crying</li>
            <li>Hungry</li>
            <li>Tired</li>
            <li>Sleeping</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            Given Appa's various states, they are mostly effected by outside stimuli, below you will find actions you can take <br>
            in the forms of buttons. These buttons will help Appa transition between his different states, but there are also uncontrollable <br>
            factors that can affect him as well, such as time, lack of attention, and hunger. Above Appa a header displays the state in which <br>
            he is in, and below that is a hint on how to bring him back to his relaxed state. For more detailed documentation please visit <a href="appadoc.html">Appa, A Virtual Pest's Documentation.</a>
